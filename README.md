### Bash Shell Version

To accurately follow the course, you will need Bash version 4+. If you have a lower version, then not everything will work as expected, but you can still follow the course.

You can find out your version by typing: `echo $BASH_VERSION` in your terminal.

If you get no output, you may not be in bash at all (see above).

If you are using a Mac, then by default you will have version 3.x. See [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193411/update-bash-to-version-4-0-on-osx) for advice on upgrading.

### Basic Shell Utility Knowledge

You don't neeed much shell utility knowledge to follow the course, but if you are unsure whether you have the basic proficiency required I recommend following [this short course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html).
